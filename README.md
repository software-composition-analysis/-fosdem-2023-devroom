# FOSDEM 2022

## Devroom Title: "Software composition and dependency management"

As we all assemble more and more complex software from an ever growing number of free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must for security, legal and operational reasons.

To deal with those new challenges a set of techniques and tools have emerged and are spanning topics from dependency management to software composition analysis (SCA). They should help you to determine which software dependencies are embedded in your project, where and how (directly or indirectly), as well as their origin, licensing, vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.

Are you contributing to a FOSS project that aims to make the lives of developers easier? You are looking for what's coming next to help you deal with your project's long list of dependencies? If so, come and join us at FOSDEM 2022 to share your techniques, experiences, and demo your FOSS tools to collaborate towards a better FOSS toolchain.

## Call for Proposals

We are interested in demos, presentations and panel discussions on software composition analysis, dependencies management and related topics.
If you want to make your talk a bit more in-theme with the conference at large, take a peek at what FOSDEM published from previous years. Also, keep in mind this event is about free and open source software, not proprietary code and data.

## Some submission ideas:

- Tracing
  - Binary analysis that trace and guess the libraries compiled or minified in larger packages
  - Build tracing and instrumentation for provenance and compliance
  - Tools that can analyze, resolve and trace dependencies

- Matching
  - Source and binary code matching to determine or verify code provenance based on indexes and similarities at the package, file or snippet levels.

- Scanning
  - Parsing and collecting dependency declarations and package manifests metadata
  - Detecting and analyzing code licenses, copyright and other provenance clues

- Vulnerabilities
  - Discovering, cataloging, correlating and classifying vulnerabilities
  - Finding vulnerabilities in dependencies

- FOSS supply chain integrity
  - Securing the FOSS supply chain at large

- Software Bill of Materials
  - Producing SBoMs
  - Consuming SBoMs
  - Translating between different SBoM formats

- Other open source software composition and dependencies topics
  - Combining origin with analysis of vulnerabilities
  - Augmenting SCA data with manual curation
  - Analysis automation and machine learning for compliance
  - Code analysis workflows, integration and analysis scripting
  - License compliance tooling, license compatibility automation
  - Tooling project update
  - Sharing your story of using SCA and dependency management tools
  - Automating policies

## Why us?

We represent several collaborating and diverse FOSS projects and foundations such as Fossology, FASTEN, SW360, ScanCode and VulnerableCode from OW2, Eclipse, the Linux Foundation and independent projects.  We co-organized separately two dev rooms at FOSDEM 2020 that were both successful but would have been even more interesting combined together. We want to organize this joint dev room this year with a longer duration (1 full day) and hopefully will be all able to meet in person again.
