# FOSDEM 2022

## Software composition and dependency management devroom

As we all assemble more and more complex software from an ever growing number of free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must for security, legal and operational reasons.

To deal with those new challenges a set of techniques and tools have emerged and are spanning topics from dependency management to software composition analysis (SCA). They should help you to determine which software dependencies are embedded in your project, where and how (directly or indirectly), as well as their origin, licensing, vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.

Are you contributing to a FOSS project that aims to make the lives of developers easier? You are looking for what's coming next to help you deal with your project's long list of dependencies? If so, come and join us at FOSDEM 2022 to share your techniques, experiences, and demo your FOSS tools to collaborate towards a better FOSS toolchain.

## Call for Proposals

We are interested in demos, presentations and panel discussions on software composition analysis, dependencies management and related topics.
If you want to make your talk a bit more in-theme with the conference at large, take a peek at what FOSDEM published from previous years. Also, keep in mind this event is about free and open source software, not proprietary code and data.

## Some submission ideas:

- Dependencies and Tracing
  - Tools that can analyze, resolve and trace dependencies
  - Binary analysis that trace and guess the libraries compiled or minified in larger packages
  - Build tracing and instrumentation for provenance and compliance

- Matching
  - Source and binary code matching to determine or verify code provenance based on indexes and similarities at the package, file or snippet levels.

- Scanning
  - Parsing and collecting dependency declarations and package manifests metadata
  - Detecting and analyzing code licenses, copyright and other provenance clues

- Vulnerabilities
  - Discovering, cataloging, correlating and classifying vulnerabilities
  - Finding vulnerabilities in code and dependencies

- FOSS supply chain integrity
  - Securing the FOSS supply chain at large

- Software Bill of Materials
  - Producing and Consuming SBoMs
  - Translating between different SBoM formats

- Other open source software composition and dependencies topics
  - Combining origin with analysis of vulnerabilities
  - Augmenting SCA data with manual curation
  - Analysis automation and machine learning for compliance
  - Code analysis workflows, integration and analysis scripting
  - License compliance tooling, license compatibility automation
  - Tooling project update
  - Sharing your story of using SCA and dependency management tools
  - Automating policies
  - SCA combined with other techniques, such as static analysis

If you are some suggestions, if you are not sure you talk fit in the devroom theme feel free to post in the [discussions](https://github.com/software-composition-analysis/fosdem-2022-devroom/discussions) section.

## Talks format

Since this is going to be a virtual event, we are planning to use the following structure:

The entire devroom will be structured into several session blocks: Each block will be dedicated to a relevant topic, as listed above. Each of the blocks are planned to start with 3 short **lightning talks about 15 minutes** (might be a little bit less but not more) each as the first part. These presentations need to be **pre-recorded** ahead of time.

Then, in the second part of the session, the three speakers of this session will join for a 30 minutes **live online panel** on Jitsi for live Q&A and panel discussion moderated by one of the volunteer organizers of this devroom.

With this approach we plan to support a combination of prepared presentations and interactive discussions even for a virtual event.

Once your talk is accepted, we will be there to help you to produce the pre-recorded content. We will review the content, ensure it has the required quality and make sure (after you upload it) the content is into the system and ready to broadcast. On the D day, you must be available online during the whole "block" to answer participants questions received in the chat.
    
## How to submit?

Please submit your proposals at https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22 Deadline: **December 19th 2021**.

If you already have a Pentabarf account (for example as a result of having submitted a proposal in the past), make sure you use it to log in and submit your proposal. Do not create a new account if you already have one. Please provide a bit of information about yourself under Person -> Description -> Abstract. When you submit your proposal (creating an "Event" in Pentabarf), make sure you choose "Software composition and dependency management devroom" in the track drop-down menu. Otherwise your proposal might go unnoticed. Fill in at least a title and abstract for the proposed talk (note that abstract and full description will be concatenated).

What information are required: 
- General: First and last name / Nickname (optionnal) / Image
- Contact:
  - email address
  - mobile number (this is a very hard requirement as there will be no other reliable form of emergency communication on the day)

Create an event:
- On the General page: Event title (required) / Event subtitle (optionnal).
- Track: Select "Software composition and dependency management devroom"
- Event type: Lecture (talk)
- Persons: Add yourself as speaker with your bio.
- Description: Abstract (required) / Full Description (optionnal)
- Links: Add relevant links.

If you have any issues, please contact dependency-devroom-manager at fosdem.org. You can also send us a notification of your submission there.

**Important dates:**
- December 19th 2021: Deadline for submission of proposals
- December 27th 2021: Final notification to authors
- December 31th 2021: Developer rooms publish complete schedules
- First two weeks of January: Period for recording and uploading talks by speakers
