# FOSDEM 2022

## Devroom Title: "Software composition and dependency management"

As we all assemble more and more complex software from an ever growing number of free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must for security, legal and operational reasons.

To deal with those new challenges a set of techniques and tools have emerged and are spanning topics from dependency management to software composition analysis (SCA). They should help you to determine which software dependencies are embedded in your project, where and how (directly or indirectly), as well as their origin, licensing, vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.

Are you contributing to a FOSS project that aims to make the lives of developers easier? You are looking for what's coming next to help you deal with your project's long list of dependencies? If so, come and join us at FOSDEM 2022 to share your techniques, experiences, and demo your FOSS tools to collaborate towards a better FOSS toolchain.

## Call for Proposals

We are interested in demos, presentations and panel discussions on software composition analysis, dependencies management and related topics.
If you want to make your talk a bit more in-theme with the conference at large, take a peek at what FOSDEM published from previous years. Also, keep in mind this event is about free and open source software, not proprietary code and data.

## Some submission ideas:

- Dependencies and Tracing
  - Tools that can analyze, resolve and trace dependencies
  - Binary analysis that trace and guess the libraries compiled or minified in larger packages
  - Build tracing and instrumentation for provenance and compliance

- Matching
  - Source and binary code matching to determine or verify code provenance based on indexes and similarities at the package, file or snippet levels.

- Scanning
  - Parsing and collecting dependency declarations and package manifests metadata
  - Detecting and analyzing code licenses, copyright and other provenance clues

- Vulnerabilities
  - Discovering, cataloging, correlating and classifying vulnerabilities
  - Finding vulnerabilities in code and dependencies

- FOSS supply chain integrity
  - Securing the FOSS supply chain at large

- Software Bill of Materials
  - Producing and Consuming SBoMs
  - Translating between different SBoM formats

- Other open source software composition and dependencies topics
  - Combining origin with analysis of vulnerabilities
  - Augmenting SCA data with manual curation
  - Analysis automation and machine learning for compliance
  - Code analysis workflows, integration and analysis scripting
  - License compliance tooling, license compatibility automation
  - Tooling project update
  - Sharing your story of using SCA and dependency management tools
  - Automating policies
  - SCA combined with other techniques, such as static analysis

## Why us?

We represent several collaborating and diverse FOSS projects and foundations such as Fossology, FASTEN, SW360, ScanCode and VulnerableCode from OW2, Eclipse, the Linux Foundation and independent projects.  We co-organized separately two dev rooms (Dependency Management and Software Composition) at FOSDEM 2020 that were both successful but would have been even more interesting combined together. We want to organize this joint dev room this year with a longer duration (1 full day) and hopefully will be all able to meet in person again.

## Why FOSDEM?

Software composition and dependency management are important for software at large and for FOSS software in particular. The related field of OSS license compliance was included in the past years in the Legal and Policy Devroom, but in the last few FOSDEM the Legal and Policy Devroom focus has been much more on policy and less on tooling. This is a good thing in of itself, but it has left FOSS developers of such tools without an outlet to meet and collaborate at FOSDEM. The continuation from a successful FOSDEM devroom last year feels like a natural progression. There was a real interest for the topic then and it has grown since.

Since this is going to be a virtual event, we are planning to use the following structure:

The entire devroom will be structured into several session blocks: Each block will be dedicated to a relevant topic, as listed above. Each of the blocks are planned to start with 4 to 5 short lightning talks about 10-15 minutes each as the first part. These presentations will be pre-recorded ahead of time by each of the presenters.

Then, as a second part of the block, a virtual live panel for 15 mins is planned with the speakers of the lightning talk as panelists and a moderator asking questions and moderating questions from the participants (assuming there will be a jitsi-like setup available). 
With this approach we plan to support a combination of prepared presentations and  interactive discussions even for a virtual event.
