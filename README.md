# FOSDEM 2022
Devroom Title: "Software composition and dependency management"

As we all assemble more and more complex software from an ever growing number of free and open source software components, knowing what's in our code is a must for security, legal and operational reasons.

To deal with those new challenges a set of techniques and software, spanning from dependency management to Software Composition Analysis (SCA), have emerged. They should help you to determine which software dependencies are embedded in your project, where and how (directly or indirectly), as well as their origin, licensing, vulnerabilities, quality and other important attributes.

You are contributing to a project that aim to make life of developers easier? You are looking for what's come next to help you deal with your project long list of dependencies? If so, come and join us at FOSDEM 2022 to share your techniques, experiences, and demo your FOSS tools to collaborate towards a better FOSS toolchain.
